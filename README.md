# Using LSTM and ARIMA Models for Stock Forecasting
The LSTM model serves as the primary forecasting tool, leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. However, recognizing that even sophisticated models like LSTM can have prediction biases, an ARIMA model is employed to estimate and correct these errors. By doing so, the system harnesses the strengths of both models: LSTM's deep learning capabilities for handling complex patterns and ARIMA's effectiveness in modeling time series data.

The repository includes a detailed script that outlines the entire process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The data_loader function sets the stage, preparing the dataset for analysis. It's followed by a series of plotting functions that visualize various aspects of the data, such as raw time series, training versus testing sets, and prediction errors.

The LSTM model's architecture is defined with several layers, including LSTM and Dense layers, and the model is trained using the historical closing prices of financial assets. After training, the model's predictions are plotted against the actual values to visualize the performance.

The ARIMA model then steps in to calculate the error of the LSTM's predictions. These error estimates are subsequently used to adjust the LSTM predictions, resulting in a final, corrected output. This final prediction is believed to be more accurate and is visualized alongside the actual data for evaluation.

Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated to quantify the accuracy of the models. The repository captures these metrics in a structured format, allowing for clear interpretation of the model's effectiveness.


## Data

Time-series data is a sequential collection of data points recorded at specific time intervals. In financial markets, time-series data primarily consists of stock prices, trading volumes, and various financial indicators gathered at regular time intervals. The significance of time-series data lies in its chronological order, a fundamental aspect that enables the identification of trends, cycles, and patterns critical for forecasting.


## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):
### Sequential Data Analysis a Leap Forward with LSTM Networks

### Introduction :
The inception of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks marked a pivotal advancement in the field of sequential data analysis. These networks, a specialised evolution of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, emerged to address the challenge of preserving information over extended sequences – a hurdle where traditional RNNs faltered due to the vanishing gradient dilemma. LSTMs were ingeniously crafted to retain critical data across long intervals, ensuring that pivotal past information influences future decisions.

### Decoding LSTM Mechanisms : 
In my program, I have utilised TensorFlow to construct and train an LSTM-based model for a specific task, likely related to time series forecasting. Let's break down how each of the LSTM components corresponds to my program:

### Memory Cell (LSTM Cell) :

In my program, the memory cell is represented implicitly by the LSTM layer I've added using tf.keras.layers.LSTM(number_nodes, input_shape=(n, 1)). This LSTM layer acts as the memory cell of the network.
The memory cell's purpose in my program is to capture and retain information over extended sequences. It is responsible for learning and remembering patterns and dependencies in the input time series data (middle_data) over time.

### Input Gate:

The input gate is a crucial part of an LSTM unit that regulates what information should be added to the memory cell. It uses a sigmoid function to control the flow of input information and employs a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function to create a vector of values ranging from -1 to +1.

In my program, the input gate is implicitly implemented by the LSTM layer (tf.keras.layers.LSTM) within TensorFlow. The LSTM layer manages the flow of input information, determines what information should be stored in its cell state, and applies appropriate weightings using sigmoid and tanh functions.

### Forget Gate:

The forget gate is responsible for deciding which information in the memory cell should be discarded. It employs a sigmoid function to assess the importance of each piece of information in the current memory state.
In my program, the forget gate's functionality is automatically handled by the LSTM layer. It learns to decide which information from the previous memory state should be forgotten or retained based on the patterns and dependencies it identifies in the input data.

### Output Gate:

The output gate extracts valuable information from the memory cell to produce the final output. It combines the content of the memory cell with the input data, employing both tanh and sigmoid functions to regulate and filter the information before presenting it as the output.
In my program, the output gate's operations are also encapsulated within the LSTM layer. It takes the current memory state and the input data to produce an output that is used for making predictions.


## ARIMA: 
### The Linear Approach to Time-Series Forecasting

### Introduction to the ARIMA Model:
The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model stands as a fundamental pillar within the realm of statistical time-series analysis. Its inception by Box and Jenkins in the early 1970s brought forth a powerful framework that amalgamates autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) elements, all while incorporating differencing to stabilise the time-series (the "I" in ARIMA). ARIMA models are celebrated for their simplicity and efficacy in modelling an extensive array of time-series data, notably for their proficiency in capturing linear relationships.

- Error Mining with ARIMA : After LSTM's predictions, the program calls on ARIMA to refine these forecasts. The Error_Evaluation function comes into play here, extracting the difference between the predicted and actual prices—essentially capturing the LSTM's predictive shortcomings.

- ARIMA's Calibration : With the error data in hand, the ARIMA_Model function is invoked, wielding the ARIMA model as a fine brush to paint over the imperfections of the LSTM's initial output. The ARIMA model is trained on these residuals, learning to anticipate the LSTM's prediction patterns and, more importantly, its prediction errors.

- Synthesis of Predictions : The Final_Predictions function represents the judgement of the program's operations. It does not merely output raw predictions but synthesises the LSTM's foresight with ARIMA's insights, producing a final prediction that encapsulates the strengths of both models.


## Integrating LSTM and ARIMA

The integration of LSTM and ARIMA models presents a compelling hybrid approach to time-series forecasting. This methodology draws on the strengths of both models: LSTMs are capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, while ARIMA excels at modelling the linear aspects of a time-series. By combining these two, one can potentially mitigate their individual weaknesses and enhance the overall predictive power.

### Analysis of Combined Model Predictions : 
Upon integrating LSTM and ARIMA, the model becomes robust against the volatility and unpredictability of financial time-series data. The predictions from the LSTM can be refined by the ARIMA model's error correction mechanism, which adds another layer of sophistication to the forecasts.

### Comparative Analysis: LSTM vs. LSTM+ARIMA vs. Actual Values :

The predictions from LSTM, the hybrid LSTM+ARIMA model, and the actual values, several insights emerge. The LSTM model may capture the momentum and direction of stock prices effectively, but it might struggle with precision due to its sensitivity to recent data. The ARIMA model, conversely, may lag in capturing sudden market shifts but provides a smoothed forecast that averages out noise.

The hybrid model aims to balance these aspects. The LSTM component may anticipate a trend based on recent patterns, and the ARIMA part can adjust this forecast by considering the broader historical context. The final predictions, ideally, are more aligned with the actual values than either model could achieve on its own.
